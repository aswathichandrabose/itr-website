        <h1>OUR STORY</h1><br>
          <p class="centerallignment">  <strong>Tiffin Room (ITR) specializes in authentic Indian street food that is inspired by the bustling streets of India.</strong> <br></p>
            
           <p class="centerallignment"> The food at Indian Tiffin Room stays true to its roots and is an exciting amalgamation of various regional dishes which are popular in different parts of India. The menu is healthy, (the standard menu is around 70% meant-free), clean and rich in flavours.<br></p>
            
            <p class="centerallignment"> Tiffin Room prides itself on the delicacy of the spice – our food is not influenced by heavily flavoured spices and there are no chilli ratings! We offer authentic dishes such as our famous ‘Dosa’ (rice pancakes), ‘Thali’ (mini buffet on a plate), an array of Chaats (finger-licking good!), Kebabs, Indo-Chinese food and much more. We have a fully stocked bar, and our cocktails are sublime, influenced by the food with special blends of spice and unusual mixes of spirits – there will be an Indian Tiffin Room take on all your favourites!
            
            Enjoy delicious Indian Street Food in the comfort of your own home.
            Delivered to your front door. Order today!<br></p>
